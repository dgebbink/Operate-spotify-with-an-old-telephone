#Operate spotify with an old telephone
This project is based on how to "hack" a rotary phone and connect it to a Raspberry Pi. In the version I saw, an old rotary phone was used to practice multiplication calculations. In my (this) version I use the phone to operate Spotify.

Until now
- the phone reads RFID tags and with write.py you can link a tag to a spotify URL
- the phone reads RFID tags via read.py, a tag is read and then the relevant link is played via Spotify
- the telephone detects through readfunction.py whether the receiver has been lifted, recognizes which number has been dialed with the dial and recognizes whether the bottom right button has been pressed.
